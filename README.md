# Trento Protontherapy TOPAS Implementation and Microdosimetric Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter

## Overview

This repository contains the TOPAS implementation of the Trento Protontherapy passive line and the microdosimetric implementation of a Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter (TEPC). The code is designed for simulating and analyzing the behavior of proton therapy in the context of the Trento Protontherapy passive line and microdosimetric measurements using a TEPC.

## Features

- **TOPAS Implementation:** Simulate proton therapy using the TOPAS Monte Carlo simulation framework.
- **Microdosimetric TEPC:** Implement a Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter for microdosimetric measurements.
- **Trento Protontherapy Passive Line:** Specific features related to the Trento Protontherapy passive line.

## Requirements

- [TOPAS](https://topas.ific.uv.es/) (Monte Carlo simulation software)

## Usage

1. Install TOPAS according to its documentation.
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repository`
4. Execute the simulation: `topas run input_file.in`

## Input Files

- `trento_protontherapy.in`: Input file for the TOPAS simulation of the Trento Protontherapy passive line.
- `microdosimetry_tepec.in`: Input file for the microdosimetric TEPC simulation.

## Results

- Output files and analysis results will be generated in the `output/` directory.
